        I am launching this site to share my
           investment experience and strategies.
           It starts with the "Stock Pick from Indexes".
           The process of this is picking a stock index holdings
           and use the CAP/M to evaulate the best Weighting.
           I only pick the Maximum Sharpe Ratio, ie, the return/risk
           ration.
