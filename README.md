v 2.0   Online Portfolio Optimization System

        Python3/Django
        
        The System collects daily closing price for selected stocks from S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, and Hang Sang Index (HK).
        The system runs the Portfolio Optimization logic with each index group of stocks with two years of daily closing price. 
        It selects the optimized portfolio weighting with the highest Sharpe's ratio, i.e., the highest return/risk ratio.
